### 🥀 Hi
Im ᴅᴊʟᴏʀ3xᴢᴏ, 20 y/o developer from Monza, Italy.
- I love to create projects for the games I play.
- I mainly use C++, C# and python. Im currently learning Unreal Engine and all the things related to it.
- I code a lot, listen to music most of the day and hang out with my girlfriend and my friends every day (yes, I touch grass).

If you need me for something, here's my site: [djlorexzo.dev](https://djlorexzo.dev/)
